# Digital Product Passport (DPP) Example

[Digital Product Passport (DPP)](https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/calls-proposals/digital-product-passport_en) is a European initiative that seeks to improve the circular economy by optimizing the design, manufacture, and use of products. This initiative consists of collecting and disseminating information on products during the different stages of their life cycle.

In this example we show how to generate part of the code to deploy a DPP web application and the [RDF Turtle format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)) vocabulary that would be used in a DPP dataspace. More details about this implementation and technical concepts can be found in our [post](https://modeling-languages.com/digital-product-passport-data/).

The structural model representing the DPP domain is shown in the following diagram. This model has been implemented in BESSER, you can access the code in the file [dpp_model.py](./dpp_model.py).

In this example, we are using two code generators:

* The Django generator to produce the code for the model layer of a web application. The `django_code/models.py` file will be generated. Check [here](./dpp_model.py#L228-L230) the implementation.

* The RDF generator to produce the vocabulary in RDF Turtle format. The `rdf_code/vocabulary.ttl` file will be generated. Check [here](./dpp_model.py#L232-L234) the implementation.

Run the script `dpp_model.py` to obtain the code generated by BESSER. 

```sh
python dpp.py
```

You can use the generated code for your DPP web application develope using Django. The following image shows the graphical user interface of the web app to create a product passport. The left panel contains the list of structural model concepts (such as the lifecycle stages of a product), while the right side displays the form for creating a new product passport.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later.
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment
  (e.g. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
  [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html))
- Install the [besser package](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER):

```bash
pip install besser
```
