# BESSER Examples

Welcome to the [BESSER](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER) examples repository! This collection shows a variety of scenarios 
implemented with BESSER, our low-modeling low-code open-source platform. These examples show the different ways to create a model 
in BESSER and the use of the different code generators. Feel free to explore these examples to gain insights into building and 
implementing your own domains with BESSER.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later.
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment
  (e.g. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
  [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html))
- Install the [besser package](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER):

```bash
pip install besser
```

### Getting Started
 
To run the example or contribute your own, follow the instructions provided within each example's folder. These instructions will 
guide you through the setup, configuration, and execution of the BESSER model.

### Contributions

We encourage contributions from the community! If you've implemented an interesting scenario or domain using BESSER, or have improvements 
to existing ones, please consider creating a pull request. Together, we can expand the library of examples to help others learn and build 
amazing BESSER models.
